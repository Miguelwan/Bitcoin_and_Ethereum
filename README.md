# Trading and R

In this project I use different tools of R to study the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The tools in this project can be used to get information from yahoo about 
some criptocurrencies. This information can be use to do simple analysis, see how 
strong is the currency, etc.

The PDF related to the notebook can be found <a href="https://www.miguelmath.com/articles/BTC-ETH-BAT.pdf">here</a>.
